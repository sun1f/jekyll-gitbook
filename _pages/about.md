This is an about page showing something about me and this blog.🛎  

My name is Elliot. I am a second-year postgraduate student, currently doing research in the direction of visual SLAM. I expect to graduate next year⏳ and plan to engage in related work. I like to learn various computer technologies in my spare time. Since I am very interested in the exquisite web design made by the front end, I decided to use the open source framework jekyll to make a blog project of my own, hoping to continue learning in practice.🥂  

The content of the blog has not been fully determined. It is probably some sharing about my own life and my experience in technical learning. I will update it from time to time and gradually complete the content of this website.🖋 I sincerely hope you like it.🧡 

Finally, thanks again to the development team of the jekyll framework, this is a wonderful project for front-end newbies like me.😊
